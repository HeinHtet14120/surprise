## After Uploading Photos

Once you've uploaded your photos, you'll need to update the configuration file to use your real photos instead of the placeholder SVGs.

**Ask me to help with:**
- "Update the config to use my uploaded photos"
- "Replace all SVG placeholders with my JPG photos"

I'll automatically update `/config/site-content.ts` to point to your uploaded photos!
