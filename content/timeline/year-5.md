Five years together, and I love you more today than I did yesterday. This year represents not just where we've been, but all the beautiful tomorrows stretching out before us.

**This Year's Magic:**

- Every single day I get to wake up next to you
- The way you still make my heart skip a beat with just a smile
- All the inside jokes and shared memories that are ours alone
- Knowing that no matter what comes, we'll face it together
- Looking forward to forever with my best friend, my partner, my love
