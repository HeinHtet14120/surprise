By year three, we had found our rhythm. We knew each other's quirks, finished each other's sentences, and loved each other even more deeply than before.

**Beautiful Highlights:**

- That perfect summer evening picnic watching the sunset
- Adopting our first plant (or pet!) together and becoming "parents"
- All the lazy Sunday mornings with coffee and conversation
- Your support when I needed it most—you're my rock
- Creating a life that feels like home, wherever we are
