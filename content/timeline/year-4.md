Year four was about putting down deeper roots. Our love matured into something steady and unshakeable, a foundation we can build our dreams upon.

**Meaningful Moments:**

- That heartfelt conversation where we planned our future together
- Celebrating milestones and achievements, big and small
- Adventures that pushed us out of our comfort zones
- The quiet strength of your hand in mine during difficult times
- Realizing that every day with you is a gift I never take for granted
