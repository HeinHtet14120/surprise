Year two brought us closer than ever. We learned that love isn't just about the grand gestures—it's in the quiet moments, the shared silences, and the comfort of being truly known.

**Cherished Memories:**

- Moving in together and making our first home
- Learning to cook your favorite dishes (even if some were disasters!)
- That amazing vacation where we explored new places hand in hand
- Supporting each other through challenges and celebrating victories together
- Building traditions that are uniquely ours
