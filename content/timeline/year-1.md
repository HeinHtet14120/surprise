Our first year was magical. From awkward first dates to late-night conversations that lasted until sunrise, we discovered each other piece by piece.

**Unforgettable Moments:**

- Our first kiss under the stars at the park
- That rainy weekend we spent indoors watching movies and laughing until our sides hurt
- The spontaneous road trip where we got lost but found each other even more
- Your smile when I surprised you with breakfast in bed
- Dancing in the kitchen at midnight to our favorite songs
