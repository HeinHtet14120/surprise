My Love,

They say love is tested not in the good times, but in the storms. This year, we've weathered some storms together, and my love for you has only grown stronger.

I want you to know that when things get hard, when life feels overwhelming, when we face challenges neither of us expected—I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. You are my choice, every single time.

Our love isn't perfect, but it's real. It's in the way we fight fair, apologize sincerely, and always come back to each other. It's in the forgiveness we offer and the grace we extend.

Thank you for showing me that true love isn't about finding someone perfect—it's about finding someone perfect for you, and choosing to grow together through every season of life.

I'm so grateful that through every spring, summer, fall, and winter, I get to walk through life with you.

All my love, always,
Yours
