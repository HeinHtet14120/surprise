My Dearest Snow,

As I write this, I'm thinking about all the miles between us—yet somehow, you've never felt closer to my heart. They say distance makes the heart grow fonder, but I don't think my heart could possibly hold any more love for you than it already does.

Being in a long-distance relationship isn't what we would have chosen, but it's shown me something incredible: that real love transcends distance. Every video call, every text message, every "I miss you" carries the weight of my entire heart. You are worth every mile, every timezone, every moment of waiting.

**The things I miss most:**

The sound of your laughter in person, not through a screen. The warmth of your hand in mine. The way you scrunch your nose when you're concentrating. Your presence beside me, not just in my thoughts. The comfort of holding you when either of us needs it. All the little moments that distance steals from us.

But here's what distance can't take away: My love for you grows stronger every single day. My commitment to us is unwavering. My belief in our future together is absolute. My heart belongs to you, completely and forever.

**What this distance has taught me:**

That you're worth waiting for. That our love is stronger than any obstacle. That every "goodnight" across the miles is a promise of "good morning" getting closer. That the day we're finally together again will be the sweetest reunion of all.

I think about our future, Snow—when we won't have to say goodbye at the end of a call, when I can hold you whenever I want, when distance is just a memory we overcame together. That future is what keeps me going. You are what keeps me going.

**My promises to you:**

I promise to bridge this distance with all the love in my heart. I promise that every mile between us only makes me more certain that you're the one. I promise to be patient, because you're worth every second of waiting. I promise that one day soon, I'll hold you close and never let go.

Until then, know this: You are my first thought in the morning and my last thought at night. You are my reason to smile even on the hardest days. You are my home, no matter where you are. You are my Snow, and I am forever yours.

The distance is temporary, but my love for you is eternal.

**I love you** across every mile, through every time zone, beyond every obstacle. I love you with all that I am, and all that I'll ever be.

Until we're together again, my beautiful Snow, know that my heart is with you always.

*Missing you terribly, loving you endlessly,*
*Counting down the days until I can hold you again,*

**Forever yours, no matter the distance ❤️❄️**

P.S. - Every day apart is one day closer to never being apart again. I can't wait for that day.
