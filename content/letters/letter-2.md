Hey You,

I was trying to list all the reasons I love you, but I ran out of paper! Here are just a few of my favorites:

1. The way you scrunch your nose when you're concentrating
2. Your terrible jokes that somehow always make me laugh
3. How you always know when I need a hug (even when I don't say it)
4. Your passion for the things you care about
5. The way you make even mundane tasks feel like adventures
6. Your kindness to everyone you meet
7. That cute little snore you deny you make
8. How you remember the smallest details about things I care about
9. Your unwavering belief in me, even when I doubt myself
10. The way you look at me like I'm the only person in the world

And about a million more reasons I discover every single day.

Love you forever and always,
Me
