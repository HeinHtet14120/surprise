## Until We're Together Again, My Snow

As this journey through our memories comes to an end, know that our love story is far from over. Every day with you—whether through a screen or side by side—is a blessing I never take for granted.

Five years of loving you has taught me that true love knows no distance. The miles between us right now are temporary, but my love for you is eternal. I look forward to the day when "long-distance" becomes "long-lasting" in person, when we can build our forever together without saying goodbye.

**Thank you, my beautiful Snow:**

Thank you for choosing me across the distance. Thank you for every video call, every message, every "I love you" that bridges the miles. Thank you for being patient, for being strong, for believing in us. Thank you for being my Snow—pure, beautiful, one of a kind.

This is not an ending—it's a promise:

- ❄️ I promise to love you through every mile until there are no more miles between us
- ❄️ I promise that distance is making us stronger, not weaker
- ❄️ I promise that one day soon, I'll hold you and never let go
- ❄️ I promise you my heart, today and always, no matter where we are

**Happy 5th Anniversary, my love. Happy Birthday, my Snow. Happy countdown to our forever together.**

Missing you, loving you, waiting for you,
Yours across every mile and beyond,
**Forever and always ❤️❄️**

P.S. - The best is yet to come, Snow. Our story is just beginning. 🌸✨
