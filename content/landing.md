From the moment we met, I knew you were special, Snow. This website is my love letter to you—celebrating five incredible years of our journey together. Years filled with love that transcends distance, laughter that echoes across miles, and a bond that grows stronger with each passing day.

Despite the distance between us, you've never felt far from my heart. You are my everything.
